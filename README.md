The WebCamRecognision.py is a simple example of facial recognision that gets input from the camera and identifies
in real time if the person from the Eu.jpg file is identifed in the input from the camera.
If the person is successfully identified hes/hers name will be displayed on the screen. If there are aditional persons 
that are identified but they do not have a picture and their name saved, under thir faces there will be a "unknown" message displayed.

Before you can run the WebCamRecognision.py file you have to make sure that you have all the libreries installed.

The required libraries are:
